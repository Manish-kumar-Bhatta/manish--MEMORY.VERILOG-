# Design and Verification of Memory with Frontdoor and Backdoor Access

This project demonstrates the *design and verification of a memory model* with both *frontdoor (normal access)* and *backdoor (direct access)* mechanisms using *Verilog* in *ModelSim*.

The goal is to provide a clear understanding of memory operations, verification strategies, and access mechanisms commonly used in *hardware verification environments*

## 🚀 Features

 *Memory Design*

  * Configurable depth and width.
  * Supports *read* and *write* operations.
  * 
## *Frontdoor Access*

  * Normal access through bus interface or signals.
  * Simulates how a CPU or external controller interacts with memory.
    
## *Backdoor Access*

  * Direct manipulation of memory contents without going through bus transactions.
  * Useful for *testbench initialization, forcing values, and fast data loading*.

## *Testbench*

  * Implements *stimulus generation, **self-checking, and **reporting*.
  * Verifies both access mechanisms independently and in combination.
